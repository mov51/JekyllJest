I have a penchant for processes and twisting my perspective to solve problems. I try to use that to help communities related to my interests by collating and communicating information in ways that I hope others can understand. 

I'm currently in the process of transitioning Male to Female and work as a Help Center writer at WinterNode, so you'll find me writing about my experiences with the former here on my blog and you'll find some of my information communication work at [The WinterNode Help Center.  ](https://help.winternode.com/50e0f53820f1441e86206e3ecae45e38)

I've been an avid Minecrafter for about 8 years and have never gone more than a month without playing since creating my account. More often than not I've played every day. Minecraft itself makes up one of my biggest interests and most of my projects are related to it. I have a post about why Minecraft interests me so much it [here]({% post_url 2019/10-October/2019-10-10-my-minecraft-adiction %}).
