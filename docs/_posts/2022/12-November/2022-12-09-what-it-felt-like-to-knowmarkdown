I'm so tired of seeing discussion about how children can't know that they're transgender or whatever before X age while I know for a fact that I did. I don't expect to sway anyone who has a hard lined stance on that idea, but I want to explain how that felt for me and the situation I was in. I have another post that covers why I came out so late despite knowing so far back, but I just want to cover how it felt to have always known.

### My earliest memory
The earliest memory that I associate with the idea of being transgender or at least being uncomfortable with the role that I had, was when I was around 3 or 4. I remember my mom getting my siblings and I dressed and getting upset that I couldn't wear the same things that my sister got to wear, and that I looked so "plain", I remember specifically using that word. I of course was convinced that I was supposed to wear my clothes and that my sister, who is a little over a year younger than me, had much smaller clothes than I did.

## Context
I think from here it's important to set the scene a little bit, because the rest of the memories and feelings are dependent on it. My father is very religious, he's Christian but I don't know the denomination other than it's some level of fundamental. My mom left him when I was 5 because he was abusive and started to put me and my 2 younger siblings in danger, from there we had visitation every weekend where he'd pick us up after school on Friday and drop us off at School on Monday (Or pre-school at the start).  
My mom did everything she could to make sure the 3 of us had a relationship with him, but he and I never got along very well, some of the memories I'll share will show why, but I essentially stopped visiting with him after the age of 14 when he said some very (Personally) dangerous religious based rhetoric while I was the mental hospital that broke any ties I felt for him. 
I'll probably make another post at some point going over why I was in the hospital, but the gist of it was that I was in and out of the hospital from age 12 to 16 because I was constantly angry. Only over the past year did I start admitting and working through that fact that I'd been angry at myself for never coming out.  
  
After my mom left my father, she started seeing a woman who I'd call neenee, and she would become my second mom. They'd be together until I turned 18 or so where circumstances and a head injury would tear them apart. During the early years that they were together my mom was a local advocate for LGBTQ rights in our area, and while I couldn't go to the protests or meetings myself because of my mom's fear, I knew what she was doing and I met her friends all the time. I was in the LGBTQ space and I wasn't ignorant of what it was, or who I was.  

As a final bit of context, I didn't have access to the internet until age 13 or so. Before that I used technology we got from yard sales and roadside auctions, resulting in me using cassette players, radios, walkmans, and typewriters. The reason this is relevant is that my community consisted entirely of my family, a couple of friends at school, and my fathers family until I started home schooling at 13. Even after that I didn't find a niche online until I turned 17, I was just wandering and lurking online, so I never got any feedback on how I was treating myself.  
I've always been very secretive about who I am and what i'm doing, especially online. This blog is the first place, other than to my best friend that I found online, that I've shared most of this information. But I've learned that this can help people, and that if I'd come across it when I was 13, I'd have been the better for it.

# Memories
Now for the actual memories. I'm going to do my best to keep them in chronological order and keep them as concise as I can while referring to the context above. 

### Dress Up
I'm not sure when this started, or when it stopped, but I have a distinct memory of doing this when my father was asleep downstairs and doing it after my mom left him. My sister and I would have rooms close together, and after we moved away from our father our rooms were connected to each other. So we'd wake up, or stay up, at night and play dress up while our parents slept. We'd tear my sisters closet apart and she'd pick the clothes out that we'd both wear over and over again for what felt like hours. Since we're only a year apart, we were much closer in size by the time were were doing this compared to before and she always had tons of costumes and random clothes that she rarely wore, so there was always something to try on that we hadn't before.  
It's honestly one of my favorite memories I have with her and our mom recalls walking in on us a couple of times when we got too loud after she left our father, so I at least have some amount of confirmation in that.

### Learning the word Transgender
Despite being wrapped up in the LGBTQ space with my mom, I'd just kind of assumed a lot about what was going on without asking questions about it. When I was 8 or 9, someone explained in detail what it meant to be Transgender. I don't remember how it came up, who it was, or even the way they explained it, but I remember it contextualizing what I'd been feeling at the time. I'd thought about it for days, and it was the first time I started journaling because I couldn't keep it all in my head.  
I don't have that journal anymore. I don't remember if it was thrown away or just lost, but I remember some of what I would have written about. I was getting what felt like jealous of my sister for what she got to do with her clothes and hair, and every time I had to cut my hair short it made me angry and sad beyond almost anything I'd felt. But no one knew. Even back then I was starting to hide it.  
I knew that my fathers family didn't agree with my my mom was doing, or even who she was by being with a woman, but it was so early in the movement by comparison to now that I'd never even heard them mention the word Transgender. Even if they hadn't spoken out against it, any time I expressed any interest in what my sister was doing, or my hair would get too long, or even if I picked up a "feminine habit" they'd call it out. My mom would do similar things, but always in a joking sense instead of a malicious one, but it just reinforced what my fathers family said and the idea that coming out would just be a joke.  
But it did feel better to have a word for how I felt, and even though I already knew that other people felt the same way, to know who they were and have a label for that group was better. This time period is one of the reasons that I hold on to the idea that labels matter, even if they get cumbersome to people on the outside.
