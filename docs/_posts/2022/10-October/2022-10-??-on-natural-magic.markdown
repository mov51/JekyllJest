While soft magic system have their perks, I've always loved the idea of, and active implemention of, systems that have strict rules that may or may not understood by the charecters. Even if it's never fully expained to the reader, having a system like that can be expanded on for any story is the peak of world building for me. So I've always kept that idea in the back of my mind while consuming other stories, trying to piece together disprate parts of magic, abilities, and tech to see if I could get a system that allows for just about anything but still has rules that can be exained and discovered by in-world charecters. I thinkI've started to stumble on the right ideas as of late, so I want to start writting them down on this blog.  

Some of them will be in the form of a story-like format I want to try out where a charecter will be writing about their discoveries, or a documentation of an event regarding this "Natural Magic" as I'm calling it for now. But a lot of it will be me explaining the conspts as their creator. The last option is just simpler and gives me less to worry about when I want to get the ideas out.  
This post will be paired with another that comes out at the same time, that I will also be linking here, that should cover how energy could spread and change in a world.
