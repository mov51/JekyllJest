My goal is to create a system of rules and "things" that mimic our world in how it works and can be pericieved, but also has the ability to be manipulated in ways that ours can't. So for a lot of systems I'll be falling back on the science our world has, especially outdated assumptions about how science would have woeked. The eventual goal being to make the system fluid enough that it can be interperted differently by those inide the world and still utilized to perform magical or scientific acts. 

In practice this means to start off with I'll be making a lot of assumptions about how the world works there. Things like that light travels like it does here, that matter exists normally, that animals require air, that evolotion took place at our pace, and that the universe as a whole looks similar to ours. This gives me a point of comanality between the two worlds, one where I can dive into the physics here and warp the rules to match the system over there. I hope that by relying on current, old, and new sciences from our world I can build a system that interconnects in that emergent way that makes my heart sing.
