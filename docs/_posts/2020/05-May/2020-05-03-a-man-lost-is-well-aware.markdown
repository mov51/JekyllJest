Just as darkness fuels despair
A man lost is well aware
That he built his binding lair
And his chains are locked by lack of care

Fueled by fear of change
He built unyielding chains
Mentally barred by a willful stain
His life held back by thoughts so vain

Darkness bred to fight his life
To bring order to perceived strife
Choked his mind and sight
His fear warping wrong and right
