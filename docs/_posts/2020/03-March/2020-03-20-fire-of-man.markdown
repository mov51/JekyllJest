A burning maxim defined  
The fire behind clouded eyes  
Flowing forth in kind  
A future of intersecting skies  

Words spoken by kin  
A rule made to bend  
The burned idea in sin  
Truth the masters lend  

Define a man within  
A seeker of life in flux  
Broken by evils whim  
A sleeper in rivers rush  

Fire consumes the tool  
Breaking an ashen wake  
Mans broken rule  
Fire for lifeâ€™s stolen sake
