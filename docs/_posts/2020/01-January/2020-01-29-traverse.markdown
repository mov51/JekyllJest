Traverse the lands brink  
Across every world link  
Each defined and distinct  
Making broad skies blink  

A world by which minds are made  
Through it lines can fade  
Boundaries defined melt away  
And lay to waste mans decay  

A global force for uniting  
For connecting those dividing  
And to thwart those in hiding  
A web of that needs defining  

Make of it what you will  
This miasma of man’s own skill  
A putrid sensational boil  
Of man’s own turmoil
