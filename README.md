# NaspenBlog

The repository for the naspen.net blob website. Built on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) with a customized [minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) theme. 

> This is my Blog website where I post poems, art, bits of information, or rambles that pertain to, well, just me. Thereâ€™s no major goal here. Just a place to store everything that I love making and refer to it as needed.
